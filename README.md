This code was written from scratch by following the ZIP file format specification. For CRC32 it uses a library and not raw code.

The program takes files as command line parameters, it stores files in a ZIP container with no compression. As a demo it also appends file and global comments.

To run it, you need Python 3 (version 2 won't work).
